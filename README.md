# SiftySifty (WIP)

SiftySifty is a desktop application for testing/troubleshooting mods in The Sims 3 and 4.

## Installation - MacOS
 
## Usage

* Choose which game you want to run a test for. Options currently available for The Sims 3 and 4.
* (Optional) Run a preliminary broken mod check by uploading the updated .csv file from Scarlet's Realm. Any potential problem mods found will be moved to the **quarantine** directory. **This feature is only compatible with The Sims 4**
* Run the 50/50 test by clicking the "Start Test" button. After each iteration, follow the on-screen instructions to complete the test:
    + Run your game, and troubleshoot or check if issues persist. Close out of your game.
    + If any issues persist, click "Yes"; if they do not, click "No."
    + Continue following these instructions until potential problem mods are moved to the **quarantine** directory found in **siftysiftydir**
    + The test may be canceled at any time by clicking "Cancel."
* All original mod files can be found in the backup folder. Remember to copy these files back into your original mods folder before closing the application.
* Run this test as many times as needed.
  
## To Do

* Implement user file threshold input field
